# “John *thinks* that Mary *thinks* that…” attribution of second-order beliefs by 5- to 10-year-old children

## **Core Question**

At what age do children begin to understand **second-order beliefs**—beliefs about another person’s belief (e.g., *John thinks that Mary thinks X*)—and how can this be experimentally demonstrated?

------

## **Key Concepts**

- **First-order belief:** A belief about the world (*Mary thinks the ice-cream van is in the park*).
- **Second-order belief:** A belief about someone else’s belief (*John thinks Mary thinks the van is in the park*).
- **Importance:**
  - Critical for social interaction, deception, strategic thinking, and communication (mutual knowledge).
  - Extends Theory of Mind beyond basic false-belief understanding.

------

## **Experimental Design**

- **Story paradigm** (avoiding earlier flaws like introspective reports or purely linguistic “think-bubble” tasks).
- **Prototypical story (ice-cream van):**
  1. Both John and Mary hear the van will stay at the park.
  2. John learns privately that the van moved to the church; Mary doesn’t know.
  3. Mary later *does* learn it moved, but John doesn’t know that she knows.
  4. Test: When John hears Mary went to buy ice cream, *where does he think she went?*
     - Correct answer: *Park* (since John believes Mary still thinks that).
- **Knowledge vs False-Belief versions:**
  - In the *Knowledge* version, John correctly knows Mary thinks van is in the park (simpler, solvable with first-order reasoning).
  - In the *False-Belief* version, John falsely thinks Mary thinks the van is in the park (requires true second-order reasoning).

------

## **Findings**

1. **Age-Related Development**
   - Few correct at **6 years**.
   - Rapid improvement between **7–9 years**.
   - By **9–10 years**, majority reliably succeed.
2. **Memory aids & prompts**
   - Performance improved when children were explicitly reminded: *“Remember, John doesn’t know that Mary talked to the ice-cream man.”*
   - Suggests failures were sometimes due to not recognizing when to consider second-order beliefs, not just lack of competence.
3. **Error patterns**
   - Wrong answers often based on **first-order strategies** (reasoning with Mary’s actual belief or John’s knowledge).
   - Some assumed *mutual knowledge* when John and Mary happened to both know the truth, leading to errors.
4. **Replication & robustness**
   - Across multiple experiments, the **critical developmental window is 6–8 years**.
   - By 7–8 years, with prompts, many children can manage second-order beliefs.

------

## **Conclusions**

- Children acquire the ability to represent **second-order beliefs** between **6–8 years old**, somewhat later than first-order false-belief understanding (which develops around 4–6 years).
- Success depends not only on representational ability but also on recognizing the **pragmatic relevance** of higher-order beliefs.
- This milestone underlies **strategic social interaction, understanding deception, and pragmatic communication**.
