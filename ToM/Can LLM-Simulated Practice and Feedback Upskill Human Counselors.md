## **Study Overview**

- **Goal:** Address the shortage of trained mental-health providers by testing whether **LLM-based training tools** can improve novice counseling skills.
- **System:** **CARE** – a web-based platform offering:
  - **LLM-simulated patients** (GPT-4o) for realistic practice.
  - **AI-generated feedback** (fine-tuned LLaMA-2) on empathy, reflections, questions, suggestions, with explanations and improved alternative responses.
- **Design:** Randomized controlled trial with **94 novice counselors** (online, 75-90 min sessions):
  - **Group P:** Practice only with AI patients.
  - **Group P+F:** Practice + AI feedback.
  - Pre-intervention and post-intervention chats with different AI patients; self-efficacy questionnaires and qualitative self-reflections collected.

## **Key Research Questions**

1. Does simulated practice alone improve counseling skills?
2. Does combining practice with structured AI feedback improve skill acquisition and self-awareness?
3. How do learners perceive and describe their learning experiences?

## **Major Findings**

### **1. Behavioral Skill Development**

- **Measured by LLM-based classifiers** (validated with expert annotations) for **empathy, reflections, questions, suggestions**.
- **Practice + Feedback group improved**:
  - **Reflections:** +3.6% (p = 0.034; d = 0.32)
  - **Questions:** +6.6% (p = 0.018; d = 0.36)
  - Trend toward better empathy (+5.4%, not sig.) and fewer poor suggestions (-5.5%).
- **Practice-only group worsened in empathy**:
  - **Empathy:** -9.6% (p < 0.001; d = -0.52).
- **Between-group difference for empathy:** 15% (p < 0.001; d = 0.72).
- Exposure to **good alternative empathetic responses in feedback** predicted better empathy gains.

**Implication:** Simulated practice alone may reinforce solution-oriented habits; feedback nudges learners toward **client-centered empathy and active listening**.

------

### **2. Self-Efficacy and Calibration**

- Both groups reported modest **increases in confidence**, but **self-assessment remained poorly calibrated**:
  - **Dunning–Kruger effect:** Lowest-performing quartile over-estimated abilities.
  - Calibration did not meaningfully improve with feedback.
- Practice group gained confidence in **exploration skills** (+0.36 pts/8-pt scale, p = 0.004).
- Practice + Feedback group gained in **session-management skills** (+0.36 pts, p = 0.011).

**Implication:** Confidence ≠ competence; objective behavioral assessment is crucial.

------

### **3. Qualitative Self-Reflections**

- **Practice + Feedback group:** Shifted to **client-centered approaches**—empathy, validation, open-ended questions; focused on listening and supporting client exploration.
- **Practice-only group:** Stayed largely **solution-oriented**, prioritizing giving advice though some delayed suggestions to gather more information first.
- Illustrates **feedback’s role in shaping therapeutic mindset**, not just skills.

------

## **Discussion & Contributions**

- **Feedback is essential:** Combining simulated practice with AI-driven, skill-specific feedback was critical for improving **empathy and reflective listening**.
- Effect sizes for key skills (d ≈ 0.3–0.4) are **comparable to those from human-supervised roleplays**, but CARE can scale without human resource bottlenecks.
- **Self-efficacy alone is unreliable** for assessing learning progress; objective metrics needed.
- **Limitations:**
  - Focused on short-term skill gains, not long-term retention or real-world transfer.
  - Participants were novice, online volunteers—not trained graduate counseling students.
  - Analysis centered on microskills; session-level factors like alliance not assessed.
  - Tested only client-centered microskills; generalizability to other modalities (CBT, ACT, psychodynamic) needs study.

------

## **Conclusions**

- **First large-scale randomized evaluation (N = 94) of an LLM-based counselor-training system.**
- **Practice alone may even harm empathy development**, but **practice + feedback improves empathy, reflections, and client-centered questioning.**
- **CARE** demonstrates the potential of combining **LLM-simulated patients with structured, expert-aligned feedback** to scale evidence-based mental-health skills training.
