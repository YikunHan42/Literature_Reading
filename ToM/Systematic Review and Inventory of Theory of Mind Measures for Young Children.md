# üìñ Systematic Review: ToM Measures for Young Children

## **Scope**

- Systematic review of **830 studies (1983‚Äì2019)**.
- Identified **220 distinct measures** assessing ToM in children **0‚Äì5 years old**.
- Goal: create an **inventory** and a **taxonomy** of ToM sub-abilities.

------

## **Seven Core ToM Categories**

The authors grouped tasks into **7 categories** of mental states/social understanding, plus ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù measures:

1. **Emotions** (e.g., hidden emotions, mixed emotions, moral emotions).
2. **Desires** (e.g., discrepant desires, desires influencing actions).
3. **Intentions** (e.g., understanding failed actions, predicting based on intent).
4. **Percepts** (visual/auditory perspective-taking, perception-action link).
5. **Knowledge** (e.g., see-know tasks, information/knowledge links).
6. **Beliefs** (false beliefs about content, location, identity; second-order beliefs).
7. **Non-literal communication** (irony, sarcasm, lies, humor, faux pas).
8. **Comprehensive measures** (e.g., Theory of Mind Inventory, Wellman & Liu ToM Scale).

‚Üí Altogether, subdivided into **39 specific ToM sub-abilities**.

------

## **Developmental Insights**

- **False belief tasks** (belief category) dominated research (75% of studies).
- Children usually succeed on **first-order false beliefs** between **3‚Äì5 years**.
- **Second-order false beliefs** emerge ~5‚Äì6 years and improve into adolescence.
- Implicit methods (e.g., gaze-tracking) suggest *some ToM abilities may appear as early as 12‚Äì18 months* (controversial, with replication issues).
- ToM continues to **develop through adolescence** (sarcasm, irony, faux pas).

------

## **Psychometric Challenges**

- Many tasks rely on **single items** (pass/fail), limiting reliability.
- Heavy reliance on **false belief** tasks neglects broader ToM skills.
- Only **~20% of studies** reported psychometric validation (e.g., reliability, validity).
- **Replicability crisis:** many implicit ToM findings fail to replicate.
- Lack of **standardization** across task versions (different stories, props, wording).

------

## **Contributions: ATOMS Framework**

- Proposed **Abilities in Theory of Mind Space (ATOMS)** as a taxonomy.
- Helps organize ToM sub-skills and guide **task selection** for research/clinical work.
- Encourages moving beyond false belief to a **richer assessment of ToM** (emotions, desires, irony, etc.).

------

## **Clinical & Research Applications**

- ToM deficits documented in: autism, ADHD, language impairments, schizophrenia, TBI, epilepsy, etc.
- Assessment tools useful in **diagnosis, intervention, and developmental monitoring**.
- Highlights need for **multi-method, multi-informant approaches** (direct tasks + parent/teacher reports).

------

## ‚úÖ **Takeaway:**

 This review consolidates decades of work into an **inventory of 220 ToM measures** and offers a new taxonomy (ATOMS). It underscores both the **centrality of ToM in child development** and the **gaps in measurement practices** (e.g., over-reliance on false belief, weak psychometrics).
